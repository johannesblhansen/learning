To get started with understanding a team it, it can useful to create a snapshot, which can used as a basis for working with the team.
A snapshot consist of observations of the team:

- Your observations - what you see day in and day out
- Your managers observations - what does your manager think about this team and why
- Your teams observations - this is grouping of each individual in the teams observations. What do they feel about the team, themselves, the work and how they fit in with the company.

Meeting the team members for the first time, some guiding questions can be used to gather information and help with *team observations* 

1. What is the teams responsibility and what are we currently working on
2. What do they like the best about the team, what is going really well and what is the most challenging. 

With the your own and your teams observations, get your managers observations through a meeting.

Then the snapshot can be created. It is formed as a when diagram
