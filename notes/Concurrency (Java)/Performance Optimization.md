What does performance mean? It is different compared to the context.

For example: 
High Speed Trading System requires latency 
Machine Learning needs lots of data, so performance is throughput.

Examples in the lectures is (There can be many more examples.)
- Latency
	- The time to completion of task. Measured in time units. If the problem space is one big task, then this is approach is the appropriate one.
- Throughput
	- The amount of tasks completed in a given period. Measured in tasks/time unit. If the problem space is many individual task with no dependence on each other, this is the appropriate one. 

Note that the two types of optimization is might have no impact on each other, or even negative impact on each other.
